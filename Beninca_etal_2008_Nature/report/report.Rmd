# Introduction

This is an attempt to reproduce the anaylses presented in the paper *Chaos in a long-term experiment with a plankton community*, by Elisa Benincà and others ([the paper on the Nature website](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06512.html)). Details of the methods are in [the Supplement to the Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/extref/nature06512-s1.pdf).

* Here include some text about what is presented below in the basic reproduction, and what additional was done and where that is described.

The data are available as an Excel file supplement to [an Ecology Letters publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01391.x/abstract). The Excel file contains several datasheets. Two are particularly important, as they are the source of the raw data (one contains original species abundances, the one with the nutrient concentrations). Another datasheet in the ELE supplement contains transformed variables.


# First get the raw data into R and tidy it.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

spp.abund <- read.csv("~/Dropbox (Dept of Geography)/RREEBES/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/data/species_abundances_original.csv", skip=7, header=T)
spp.abund <- select(spp.abund, -X, -X.1)
spp.abund <- spp.abund[-804:-920,]
str(spp.abund)
```

The Protozoa variable contains some numbers with comman as the decimal separator. This creates a question about what dataset was used for the original analyses, as it could not have been this one.

```{r}
spp.abund$Protozoa <- as.numeric(str_replace(spp.abund$Protozoa, ",", "."))
```

Format the dates as dates

```{r}
spp.abund$Date <- dmy(spp.abund$Date)
```

Ooops... R assumes the experiment was done in the 21st century. Shouldn't matter too much.

Data is in wide format, so change it to long:
```{r}
spp.abund <- gather(spp.abund, "variable", "value", 3:12)
str(spp.abund)
```

Bring in the nutrient data:
```{r}
nuts <- read.csv("~/Dropbox (Dept of Geography)/RREEBES/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/data/nutrients_original.csv", skip=7, header=T)
nuts <- select(nuts, -X, -X.1)
nuts <- nuts[-349:-8163,]
nuts$Date <- dmy(nuts$Date)
nuts <- select(nuts, -NO2, -NO3, -NH4)
nuts <- gather(nuts, "variable", "value", 3:4)
str(nuts)
```

Now put the two datasets together
```{r}
all.data <- rbind(spp.abund, nuts)
```

Now select only the date range used in the Nature paper. From the supplment *The analysis in Benincà et al. (Nature 2008) covered all data from 16/06/1991 until 20/10/1997*. (Remembering dates in the R dataframes are 2090s.)
```{r}
an1 <- filter(an, an$Date>dmy("16/06/2091") & Date<dmy("20/10/2097"))
```

# Reproducing figure 1b through 1g

(No attempt to reproduce Figure 1a, as its a food web diagram.)

First quick go:
```{r}
ggplot(all.data, aes(x=Day.number, y=value)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales="free_y")
```

The code from here on needs modifying, as the object names are Owen's old ones, and need changing to those used above.

First lets set the colours as in the original:
```{r}
species.colour.mapping <- c("Cyclopoids"="pink",
                            "Calanoid.copepods"="red",
                            "Rotifers"="blue",
                            "Protozoa"="green",
                            "Nanophytoplankton"="red",
                            "Picophytoplankton"="black",
                            "Filamentous.diatoms"="green",
                            "Ostracods"="lightblue",
                            "Harpacticoids"="purple",
                            "Bacteria"="black",
                            "Total.dissolved.inorganic.nitrogen"="red",
                            "Soluble.reactive.phosphorus"="black")                            
```

Next change the order of the levels in the Type variable, so plots appear in the same order as in the original figure:
```{r}
an$Type <- factor(an$Type, levels=c("Cyclopoids", "Herbivore", "Phytoplankton", "Nutrient",
                                    "Bacteria", "Detritivore"))
```

Now select only the date range used in the Nature paper. From the supplment *The analysis in Benincà et al. (Nature 2008) covered all data from 16/06/1991 until 20/10/1997*. (Remembering dates in the R dataframes are 2090s.)
```{r}
an1 <- filter(an, an$Date>dmy("16/06/2091") & Date<dmy("20/10/2097"))
```

Now a version that doesn't try to recreate the "gap" in the y axes of the original figures:
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
g1 <- qplot(as.numeric(Day), Abundance, col=Species, data=an1) +
  facet_wrap(~Type, ncol=2, scales="free_y") +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = species.colour.mapping)
g1
```
Looks reasonably good.

Now a version that approximates the "gap", by removing data above it:
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
an2 <- filter(an1, Type=="Cyclopoids" & Abundance<0.6 |
                Type=="Herbivore" & Abundance<13 |
                Type=="Phytoplankton" & Abundance<1400 |
                Type=="Nutrient" & Abundance<50 |
                Type=="Bacteria" & Abundance<10 |
                Type=="Detritivore" & Abundance<0.7) 
g1 <- qplot(as.numeric(Day), Abundance, col=Species, data=an2) +
  facet_wrap(~Type, ncol=2, scales="free_y") +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = species.colour.mapping)
g1
```
Difficult it look like the data go off the top of the graph in ggplot.

Try logarithmic y-axes:
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
g1 <- qplot(as.numeric(Day), log10(Abundance+0.00001), col=Species, data=an1) +
  facet_wrap(~Type, ncol=2, scales="free_y") +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = species.colour.mapping)
g1
```
Now we see why it can be useful to plot with a break in the y-axis, as in the original graphs.
